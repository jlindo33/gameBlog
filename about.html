                <!-- Why -->
                <h3>Why this site?</h3>
                <p>In 2013, I decided I wanted to make a career change. Being "stuck" in a retail career I decided to
                    pursue higher education at an older age. While working full-time, in 2021 I finally earned my
                    Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. However, finding a developer job has still proven to be
                    difficult. I decided to create this site for fun, but also to act as a playground where I can
                    explore HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap framework. This is my first project, the code is DRY. If I keep
                    up with it I will come back and refactor as I get better. However for now this site is just a
                    collection of random thoughts and opinions of things that interest me..</p>
                <!-- Where -->
                <h3>The backstory</h3>
                <p>It's pretty easy to say I've been gaming my whole life. I remember in 1987 my mother brought home our
                    first NES. Sure enough, the Mushroom Kingdom changed my life. Soon after Mario came the other worlds
                    and characters that grew up with me. I thought about listing them, but you know who and what they
                    are.
                </p>
                <p>It's funny how some of the
                    memories I have playing games from my childhood are some of the strongest, most vivid memories I
                    have. Some of my favorites include finding, then pulling the
                    Master Sword in A Link to the Past <em>(who am I kidding, let's just put everything in A Link to
                        the
                        Past in that favorite memories category)</em>, sleepovers and all night GoldenEye sessions and
                    of course like many westerens, my first in-depth dive into JRPG's with Final Fantasy VII. So that's
                    where it started, and there's so much in-between and after.</p>
                <!-- Passion -->
                <h3>My passion</h3>
                <p>While I love many games, in my late teens some friends I worked with introduced me to the
                    "competitive fighting game" scene, now known as the FGC (fighting game community). Of course I knew
                    fighting games, and enjoyed them very much. However, like many noobs to FGC, I thought I was good.
                </p>
                <p>I played Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat and Virtua Fighter at home and various arcades or movie
                    theaters in the area. Who didn't in the 90's? I owned Marvel vs Capcom 2 on the Dreamcast. It was a
                    system seller. However, when I played against some people that were actually good, it got my
                    competitive spirit going and I was hooked.
                </p>
                <p>Apparently I wasn't alone. This was the early days of the internet (which I didn't have) and social
                    media and twitch did not exist. Online gaming and lobbies did not exist. If you wanted competition,
                    you had to find it. However, much like the early punk rock scene, the community was active and
                    growing. I remember my friends and I sought out other people with our same passion and we would
                    drive half-way across the country just to spend a weekend and play against them. We would acquire
                    DVD's of local tournaments that were filmed on a <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camcorder">camcorder</a> to study, and then go back a few
                    months later to see where we matched up.
                </p>
                <p>That same tournament scene was getting bigger. The Battle by the Bay has recently changed to
                    Evolution, which is now Sony owned EVO. Shoryuken.com (RIP) was getting more and more traffic and
                    there was an East Coast vs West Coast rivalry growing. Japanese players were also starting which
                    forced the U.S. players to really step up their game.</p>
                <p>It was so much fun being part of that early scene. While I'm now much older and can't commit to being
                    a very active member anymore, you can still find me in the online lobbies, just look for zero_cool.
