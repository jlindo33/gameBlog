                            <p>So, I don't play many LEGO games. For the same reason I don't use TikTok, I'm almost 40.
                                The last one I
                                played my wife and I played together, and it was LEGO: The Harry Potter Collection,
                                which
                                we enjoyed.
                                However,
                                I'm a big
                                Star Wars fan and a Star Wars game that has been delayed for like four years is finally
                                here. I had to try it.

                            <p>
                                I knew what I was getting into. If you have ever played one of these games before you
                                know they're usually a third person action/adventure with bright colors and that
                                incredible LEGO humor. This delivers on of all that and more. Maybe I'm enjoying the
                                humor more because I am such a big fan of the franchise, but I found myself at times
                                laughing out loud at the scenes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The game gives you the options to start playing through each of the trilogies. However,
                                you
                                can't skip around. If you want to play "The Empire Strikes Back", you need to complete
                                "A
                                New Hope" first. Which I like. Naturally there is only ONE way to play through this
                                game,
                                and if
                                I have to explain that to you well, I don't know what else to say.
                            </p>
                            <p>The combat is simple, which again I knew what I was getting into and not
                                expecting much more than what I got. But it is very tight for what it is. I do like
                                being able to switch between characters
                                while you're not alone. Swapping over to R2-D2 so you can unlock a door is a neat
                                mechanic. I did laugh that I could swap over to C-3P0, take my torso off my legs and
                                get through an air duct to find a secret.
                            </p>
                            <p>My biggest complaint so far would be with the flying mechanics. Ok, secret. I'm an
                                inverted Y axis guy. Yes, yes I feel the disgust on your face. I don't know where it
                                started, if I had to guess maybe Star Fox
                                back on the SNES. Oh, and it took me forever to get over when it comes to aiming. I was
                                always that guy that would have to adjust the settings and piss my friends off. I was
                                able to get over aiming, but for some reason flying is still very hard for me without
                                the inverted Y. Which this game does not give you the option. With controls that were
                                made for children to master, I almost couldn't complete the trench run. Pretty
                                embarrassing...</p>
                            <p>As of right now, I'm only halfway through Empire, which means I have a long way to go. I
                                feel
                                like I need to be in the right mood to turn this one, but when I do I throrougly enjoy
                                it. If you are a Star Wars fan looking for some light easy fun at the expense of the
                                franchise, you should definitely give this a try. My hope is that the humor alone will
                                give me the motivation to get through all nine episodes, and maybe a Mandalorian DLC? I
                                think I'm asking for too much.
