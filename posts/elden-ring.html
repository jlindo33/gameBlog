                            <p>So Elden Ring is here and it’s getting perfect scores everywhere. Everyone seems to be
                                playing it, and it seems like a 100% lock for Game of the Year. So why don’t I care?

                            <p>
                                Yes, you read that correctly. I don’t care. I really asked myself why a game with so
                                much hype doesn’t interest me. Do I just not get the genius of it like I hear when I
                                tell
                                people I don’t like Monty Python or Napoleon Dynamite? I fancy myself to be a pretty
                                smart guy so I don’t think that’s it. Is it because it’s too hard? Absolutely not. I
                                love challenging games. I grew up playing Mega Man 2. So it’s not that. It’s the “Souls
                                Type” genre as a whole and that’s why I don’t care.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here’s the problem with the genre. It’s bad. Fundamentally, at the root, these games are
                                flawed. The mechanics are clunky, the graphics are sub par, there is little to no score
                                and if I have to go to reddit to get a story, well then your game doesn’t have one. I’ve
                                tried to play them. I really have. Demon Souls looked really interesting when it
                                launched and I hated it. Much later on I tried Dark Souls 3 with the same results. My
                                last attempt was with Bloodborne. One of my greatest friends whose opinion I trust very
                                much told me “It’s everything a 3D Castlevania should have been”. That’s such a great
                                sales pitch I had to pick it up. I couldn’t stand it. I feel like all three games have
                                these fundamental flaws mentioned above that I just can’t overcome.
                            </p>
                            <p>So is Elden Ring different? It might be, but I won’t give the genre another chance. For
                                one, undeniable reason and the genre’s greatest flaw. The fans of “Souls Type” games are
                                <em>just the worst</em>. I’ll put them up against Super Smash Brothers, New England
                                Patriots (I’m
                                from the Boston area for the record) and Dave Matthews fans for the most insufferable
                                people on Earth. If you tell one of these people you don't like Dark Souls or Nioh or
                                any other game in this genre, you instantly get a smug look immediately followed by
                                questions. “Is it too hard for you?” or “How can you not like it?”. After explaining my
                                reasoning they usually take some time to process, because my reasoning is fact, not
                                opinion until someone tells me otherwise and it twists their brains into a pretzel.
                                However, once the processing is over then comes the their explanation, which I just
                                debunked before hand, ultimately leading to their dumb conclusion that “I just don’t get
                                it”.
                            </p>
                            <p>It’s exhausting dealing with these people. If you tell a Smash Brothers fan that it’s not
                                a fighting game and it’s actually a party game, they lose their minds followed by
                                continuing not to shower. Next time you run into a Dave Matthews fan ask them why they
                                need to be on psychedelics to enjoy jam bands? They can’t process it. They’ll just tell
                                you that you “need to see Dave live to get it” followed by how many times they’ve seen
                                them. This is the same type of person and this, more than anything else, is the “Souls
                                Type” problem. So like most things in life, unfortunately people ruin things more than
                                the things ruining themselves…</p>
                            <p>If you got this far, thank you for allowing me to get on my soapbox. I feel better.
