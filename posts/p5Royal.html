                            <p>As mentioned in the previous page, Persona 5 is finally coming to the Nintendo Switch
                                just a little over six years after Persona 5 was released in September of 2016. The
                                Persona franchise as a whole might be one of the most unique gaming experiences one
                                could have, and Persona 5 does not disappoint. The “Royal” tag was added to the game in
                                2019 and re-released with additional content, much like Atlus did with Persona 4 Golden.
                            <p>
                                So have I played Persona 5? Yep. Have I played Royal? You bet. Am I going to buy this
                                addition on the Switch? You better believe it! However, it may not be for the reasons
                                you think. Many long time fans of the franchise have been screaming for a Switch release
                                since 2016. Being introduced to Persona 3 and Persona 4 on the Playstation Vita, it
                                seemed like a natural match to be on a handheld. However, that did not happen until now.
                                Truth be told I’m not much of a handheld gamer, I’m currently playing Dragon Quest 8 on
                                the 3DS and before that I think the last time I picked up a handheld console was when
                                Corpse Party came out. However, my wife is a handheld gamer and I am SO jealous that she
                                gets to experience not just Persona 5 Royal, but Persona in general for the first time.

                                This game just drips. Everything about it is perfect, and I don’t say that lightly. This
                                might be a perfect video game. The art is so stylish and so unique that you can use
                                “Persona” as an adjective, and people who have played the game immediately understand
                                what you are trying to say. The gameplay is just as unique. If you can imagine a JRPG as
                                a “high school simulator”, you get Persona 5. It has been a very long time since I have
                                seen something as original as the Metaverse, and how Joker and the Phantom Thieves end
                                up there. Ultimately the Metaverse is an area of the game where you can grind to level
                                up and where the dungeons are. Outside of the Metaverse in the real world is where you
                                spend your time going to school and hanging out with your friends or doing other
                                activities. It sounds strange but believe me, it works. The music slaps so hard. All of
                                the characters are unique and great. The
                                confidants fall into the same category. The Tokyo backdrop is perfect for the story, so
                                perfect that when I eventually get to Tokyo I plan to visit some of the stops in the
                                game. And then there's the story. A+ writing here.
                            </p>

                                I could talk about all the reasons why you should get this on October 21st, but we would
                                be here for a very long time. Again for all of those out there who get to experience
                                this for the first time, I’m extremely jealous, but also excited I get to talk to my
                                wife about her maiden voyage into this fabulous franchise. For those who have played it,
                                they’ve already got you twice. You may as well experience it again on the Switch,
                                because it is never a bad time to play this one again. In the meantime, just sit back
                                and enjoy the soundtrack. Friday is only three days away.
