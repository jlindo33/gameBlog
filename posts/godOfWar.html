                            <p>Santa Monica Studios gave God of War fans a little treat over the weekend. A cinematic
                                trailer for God of War Ragnarok was dropped. We don’t get to see all that much, but we
                                do see Kratos doing Kratos things and Atreus supporting him. However what really
                                interests me is how Santa Monica is going to adapt Ragnarok into their own story.

                            <p>
                                With the predecessor, they did an excellent job adapting Norse mythology into their own
                                lore. God of War ended implying that Atreus was indeed the trickster God Loki. Sorry for
                                the no “spoiler alert” but the game has been out for like four years now. If you haven’t
                                played it, that’s on you!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By no way, shape or form am I an expert in Norse mythology. Admittedly I don’t know much
                                because like most of you the only Norse mythology you know is what you learned from the
                                Thor movies. Which I haven’t seen because DC > Marvel. Anyway, I knew a giant wolf was
                                involved in the story and we showed said wolf at the end of the trailer. After some
                                quick googling I learned, which makes the last games ended even cooler, that the wolf
                                could be Fenrir. Son of Loki and a driving force in Ragnarok. I can’t wait to see how
                                they adapt this into their universe.
                            </p>
                            <p>Santa Monica is setting themselves up the same way Guerrilla Games did with Horizon
                                Forbidden West. You touch the sun once, it’s hard to get back there. But I do have faith
                                that this game will surpass the 2018 release just like 2018’s version blew away the
                                previous trilogy, which I enjoyed watching my roommate play at the time but found the
                                combat incredibly boring.
                            </p>
                            <p>Short blog, I know. Really just trying to learn how to add a video, but thanks for
                                reading!</p>
