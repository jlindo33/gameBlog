                            <p>First and foremost, following up the second best game of the last generation was not
                                going to be an easy task. However, Guerrilla Games answered the bell and it was much
                                more than I expected.

                            <p>
                                Picking up after the events of Horizon Zero Dawn we find our protagonist Aloy put into
                                another impossible save the world type of situation while dealing with robot dinosaurs.
                                It sounds ridiculous but believe me it works. Without spoiling either game, I’ll just
                                say Aloy has to venture into the forbidden west. A place that is ruled by the
                                bloodthirsty Tenakth who are still bitter about a long standing feud with the Sundom,
                                the capital of the east. They believe the people of the Sundom, the Carja, are
                                responsible for a genocide that was performed against their people during the “red
                                raids”. I really want to talk more about the story and didn’t realize writing my opinion
                                while being “spoiler free” was going to be this difficult, because the story is really
                                good. I suppose you’ll just have to play it on your own to find out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first thing you notice is how beautiful this game is. Guerrilla Games really stepped
                                up here. While the original is still beautiful and holds up, Forbidden West has a level
                                of detail I’ve only seen in The Last of Us: Part II (the best game of the last
                                generation if you were wondering). I’m playing on a Playstation Pro and was truly
                                impressed. They improved on everything in this aspect. Aloy’s trademark hair looks even
                                better. Her facial expressions are almost life-like. The supporting characters and even
                                the NPC’s look just as good. The scenery is almost photo realistic, whether you’re in a
                                tropical area or a more desolate area, nothing is ignored. I am beyond excited to play
                                on a next gen console when I decide to buy one.
                            </p>
                            <p>They also improved on the mechanics. Many of the best weapons return. Her signature bow
                                is back along with some other favorite weapons and traps, including my personal favorite
                                the trip caster. Also note that they nerfed this trap and I’m fine with that. It was way
                                too strong in the first game and this almost makes you utilize your entire repertoire of
                                tricks.
                            </p>
                            <p>However no great sequel can be made without adding new mechanics right? Forbidden West
                                gives us a few to master. First, we have a grappling hook, or hook shot for us olds.
                                This opens up the platforming in the game, which like any open world game will
                                eventually get tedious. However where this mechanic shines is in the combat. Being able
                                to quickly escape or get to higher ground is an added benefit for the player. The next
                                new mechanic we see is a glider. This is the new trend in open world games thanks to The
                                Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. However Horizon makes it their own in a very cool
                                way and again, this is a bonus to the player. It is a very satisfying feeling jumping
                                off of a mountain summit and gliding towards your next objective without worrying about
                                your stamina. The last new mechanic is we are able to swim, or more accurately swim
                                underwater. Again the people at Guerrilla have come up with a unique way to do this and
                                it gives us some great story arcs and level design..</p>
                            <p>All of these additions make Horizon Forbidden West an excellent game. I enjoyed it from
                                beginning to end and I think I did all the side quests as well. Which is exceptionally
                                rare for me. However, where the game could have improved is with its story. Let me say
                                that the story is very well written. It has light moments, heart breakers and a very
                                good twist. The supporting cast is excellent along with the actors who played them. But,
                                trying to follow up the events of Zero Dawn might be an impossible task. The twist that
                                game takes to learn who Aloy is while explaining what happened in their “post post”
                                apocalypse was brilliant. So is Horizon Forbidden West a must play? Absolutely. Get it
                                right now if you haven’t already, and if you’re new to the franchise, play Horizon Zero
                                Dawn first. You’ll thank me later and it will just make your experience with this game
                                that much better.
