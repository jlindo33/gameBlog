                            <p>If you read the "About Me" section here, you know fighting games are my passion. Street
                                Fighter may be my favorite series of all time, and my first impression...
                            <p><em>Not great.</em></p>
                            <p>
                                I suppose we can start with the past 20 years of the franchise. After seemingly
                                touching the sun with Street Fighter III: Third Strike and Capcom vs. SNK2, the series
                                has been in a downward spiral since. Street Fighter IV did some things very well, and
                                some things not so well. Then came Street Fighter V. Which in my opinion took a step
                                even further away from the greatness of the past. The art was terrible with an approach
                                that made the characters look like play doh. The game slowed way down and the mechanics
                                were simplified to approach a wider audience. Which from a business side I understand,
                                but 3 hit combos aren't very exciting to me. So this is where my fear begins.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, there might be hope! The first thing I noticed with SFVI was the art style. It
                                is definitely an improvement from SFV, but that bar is set pretty low. We get our first
                                look at series staples Ryu and Chun-Li who are returning and are re-introduced to
                                newcomer Luke and get our first look at new challenger Jamie. Ryu and Chun-Li are
                                looking older. Ryu is now rocking a beard. We see a little gray in there confirming that
                                time has passed. He has also covered up some of that chest and must have gotten tired
                                walking around barefoot because is wearing a pair of sandals for the first time. His
                                moveset looks pretty much the same. Standard fireball, dragon punch, shoto style you
                                expect. Still looks like he hits like a truck as well.
                            </p>

                            <p>I actually really like what they did with Chun-Li. They aged her gracefully. I think she
                                looks beautiful, and just like Ryu they kept many of her trademark characteristics
                                intact. Capcom has been criticized for their portrayal of women, and rightfully so, but
                                seem to have covered her up this time around, which I like. However, I'm sure that will
                                change with the inevitable DLC that will be shoved down our throats. Again, like Ryu her
                                moveset looks about the same. Fireball, spinning bird kick, lightning legs. Normals
                                still look really strong. Low forward and stand fierce will continue to be something you
                                have to worry about. It also looks like she might have multiple stances as well. I'm
                                excited to try her out. With the new "Drive" system (which I'll get to later) she has
                                the potential to be lethal.
                            </p>
                            <p>Then Capcom showed off the newcomers. Even though Luke is returning, I stopped playing
                                SFV well before his release and don't know much about him. After watching this he's
                                another shoto clone.<em>Yawn...</em> Excuse me. His design looks generic and looks
                                really annoying to play against. His fireball seemed really fast and may have gone full
                                screen. He just doesn't appeal to me at all and I really hope he isn't the heir to the
                                franchise.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <p>Jaime looks interesting. I love playing technical characters. If they have really hard
                                combos, multiple stances/meters, counters and don't do a lot of damage, that's my
                                character! This will be the first Drunken Boxer in the Street Fighter series and if he's
                                anything like Chin from King of Fighters or Lei Wulong from Tekken he could be fun.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Drive system that I talked about earlier we still don't know much about. Only that it
                                will be able to do five different things to incorporate both offensive and defensive
                                strategies. I think this mechanic could have potential, but could also lead to some
                                characters being really broken. The rest of the gameplay also gives me some trepidation.
                                Much like SFV, it seems slow and not very exciting. Furthermore, they have taken even
                                more drastic measures to cast a wider net with an even easier input system. I hope like
                                some of the ArcSys games they cater and reward long time vets who can actually execute
                                harder combos.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the end of the day really the only thing I care about is game play. I just mentioned
                                why I'm nervous, but to be fair I wasn't hands on with it. I just watched like everyone
                                else. I suppose we'll have to wait until 2023 to really get our first impression, or if
                                we're lucky late 2022 with a beta. Again Capcom, please get this right.
